## useMaybeControlled([value], [setValue]) â‡’ <code>Array</code>
Allows you to use a value that can either be set
externally or managed internally (ie. controlled vs
uncontrolled components). This hook works similar
to `React.useState` but returns an additional third
boolean which tells you if the value is controlled
externally. This is the case if the value is anything
other than undefined.

- `return[0]` gives you the state value.

- `return[1]` gives you a function to set either the
local value or the external value when the component
is being controlled. When in a controlled situation
but `setValue` is not passed, calling `return[1]` has
no effect. This can be useful if you want to notify
the external state of value changes but you don't actually
want to change the value.

- `return[2]` tells you if the value is controlled externally.

#### Example

In this example, your component controls its state unless
the user passes something for the value prop. In that case,
the user must pass both the `value` and `setValue` props in order
to control the component's state.

```js
    function MyComponent({
      value,
      setValue,
    }) {
      const [valueLocal, setValueLocal, isControlled] = useMaybeControlled(value, setValue);

      // Now you can use 'valueLocal' instead of 'value'.
      // You should also use 'setValueLocal' instead of 'setValue'.
      // You can also use the 'isControlled' value to do specific
      // work if the component is being controlled.
    }
```

#### Example 2

In this example, you want to provide two different callbacks
for setting a toggle state instead of a single `setValue` prop.

```js
    function MyComponent({
      value,
      onOpen,
      onClose,
    }) {
      const [valueLocal, setValueLocal, isControlled] = useMaybeControlled(
        value,
        v => {
          if (!!v && onOpen) onOpen();
          else if (!v && onClose) onClose();
        }
      );

      // Now you use 'valueLocal' and 'setValueLocal' in place of
      // the versions from props.
    }
```

**Kind**: global function  
**Returns**: <code>Array</code> - Returns an array structured as
  [value: *, setValue: function, isControlled: boolean]  

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [value] | <code>\*</code> | The possible external value to track. |
| [setValue] | <code>function</code> | The external setter for changing the external value. |
