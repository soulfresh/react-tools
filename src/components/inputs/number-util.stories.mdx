# Number Utils

Under the hood, the number inputs available in this package
include a large number of utilities for translating and formatting
number characters and symbols. These all take advantage of
`Intl.NumberFormat` under the hood and default to translating
based on the browser's locale. They are exposed so you can
take advantage of them should you need.
