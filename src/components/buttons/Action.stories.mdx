# Actions

In place of various `<Link>` and `<Button>` components, I prefer
to use an `<Action>` component in my projects. An `<Action>` component will
render either an `<a>` or a `<button>` based on its props and abstracts
its styling such that links can look like buttons or vice versa.

Use Actions if:

- Your project has a Link component for routed links
- and another component for unrouted links
- plus one or more components for button elements
- and your design includes links that look like button components
- and your design includes buttons that look like your link components
- and you need to share functionality like analytics between both button and link components
- and you're tired of having to remember all of the components in your project.

Actions:

- Provide a single component API to render both `<a>` and `<button>` elements.
- Abstract their styling from the underlying HTML element.
- Give you full control over the styling of your components.
- Provide a single place for reusable code between all of your links and buttons.
- Simplify refactoring by making it simple to switch between links and buttons.
- Reduce code and reduce the number of components you need to remember.
- Allow you to use any routing or analytics tools you want.
- Have zero dependencies on external libraries.

## Components

- UnstyledAction
- RoutedAction
- AnalyticsAction

## Building an Action

## Best Practices

- Keep styles agnostic to the element being rendered
- Provide a `display` prop
- Provide "feel" variations
- Provide an "unstyled" variation
- Be selective how you apply your styles
