# Popover

<Description of={Popover} />

By default `<Popover>` does not provide any styling. However, the
following is a basic example that you can find in the `src/components/popover/examples`
folder.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Popover">
    <ExamplePopover
      content={<div>Popover Content! ðŸ¤˜</div>}
    >
      <button>Menu</button>
    </ExamplePopover>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={Popover} />

## Text Trigger

You can also use raw text as the trigger for your Popover. However, be
aware of the accessibility concerns with doing this. It would make sense
for a tooltip component but would be less than ideal for a dropdown or
context menu.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="TextTrigger">
    <ExamplePopover
      content={<div>Popover Content! ðŸ¤˜</div>}
    >
      Just Text
    </ExamplePopover>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
